## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to establish a foundation for a bot support system that can handle customer inquiries, order management, and provide intelligent responses. The system should be:

- Scalable and maintainable
- Event-driven for better decoupling
- Capable of integrating with AI services
- Support multiple communication channels
- Handle complex business logic for order states

The current landscape shows increasing demand for automated customer support, and we need a robust architecture that can evolve with business requirements.

## Decision

We will implement a **Go-based microservices architecture** with the following key components:

### Core Architecture
- **Event-driven architecture** using message queues for loose coupling
- **Repository pattern** for data access abstraction
- **Use case driven design** following clean architecture principles
- **Modular structure** with clear separation of concerns

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: Go (for performance, simplicity, and strong concurrency support)
- **Framework**: Standard Go libraries with minimal external dependencies
- **Communication**: HTTP/gRPC for synchronous calls, message queues for events
- **Documentation**: ADR (Architecture Decision Records) for decision tracking

### Project Structure
```
bot-support/
├── cmd/           # Application entry points
├── src/           # Source code
│   ├── main.ts    # Main application entry point
│   └── usecases/  # Business logic implementation
│       ├── shop/  # Shop-related use cases
│       └── project/ # Project-related use cases
├── docs/          # Documentation including ADRs
└── go.mod         # Go module definition
```

### Key Design Principles
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between layers
2. **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
3. **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one reason to change
4. **Open/Closed Principle**: Open for extension, closed for modification

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Maintainability**: Clear structure makes code easier to understand and modify
- **Scalability**: Event-driven architecture allows horizontal scaling
- **Testability**: Clean separation enables comprehensive unit and integration testing
- **Flexibility**: Modular design allows easy addition of new features
- **Performance**: Go's efficient runtime and concurrency model

### Risks and Mitigation
- **Complexity**: Event-driven systems can be harder to debug
  - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to understand clean architecture
  - *Mitigation*: Documentation and code reviews
- **Over-engineering**: Risk of over-abstracting simple requirements
  - *Mitigation*: Start simple, refactor as needed

### Trade-offs
- **Development Speed**: Initial setup takes longer but pays off in maintenance
- **Memory Usage**: Go's garbage collection vs manual memory management
- **Dependencies**: Minimal external deps vs rich ecosystem usage
