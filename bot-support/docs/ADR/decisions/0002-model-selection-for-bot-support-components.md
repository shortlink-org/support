# 2. Model Selection for Bot Support Components

Date: 2025-08-01

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The bot support system requires different AI models for various specialized tasks. Each component has specific requirements for reasoning capabilities, text generation quality, and execution speed. We need to select appropriate models that balance performance, cost, and functionality for each use case.

Key requirements:
- **PR Analyzer**: Needs strong reasoning capabilities for multi-step context gathering
- **Comment Generator**: Requires fast, high-quality text generation
- **PR Executor**: Needs reliable multi-step execution for posting comments and closing PRs

## Decision

We will use different specialized models for each component based on their specific requirements:

### PR Analyzer - ai/qwen3
- **Reasoning**: Selected for superior reasoning capabilities and multi-step context gathering
- **Capabilities**: Can perform complex analysis and gather context through multiple steps
- **Use Case**: Analyzing pull requests, understanding code changes, and gathering relevant information

### Comment Generator - ai/gemma3
- **Performance**: Gemma3 models excel at text generation with fast execution
- **Quality**: Produces high-quality, coherent comments and responses
- **Speed**: Optimized for quick text generation tasks
- **Use Case**: Generating human-like comments, responses, and explanations

### PR Executor - ai/qwen3
- **Reliability**: Qwen models demonstrated best performance in multi-step execution tasks
- **Execution**: Successfully handles posting comments and closing PRs in sequence
- **Testing**: Validated through multiple experiments for this specific use case
- **Use Case**: Executing actions like posting comments and managing PR lifecycle

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Specialized Performance**: Each component uses the optimal model for its specific task
- **Better Reasoning**: Qwen3 provides superior analysis and execution capabilities
- **Faster Generation**: Gemma3 enables quick, high-quality text generation
- **Proven Reliability**: Qwen3 has been tested and validated for execution tasks

### Risks and Mitigation
- **Model Diversity**: Managing multiple models increases complexity
  - *Mitigation*: Clear component boundaries and standardized interfaces
- **Cost Management**: Different models may have varying costs
  - *Mitigation*: Monitor usage and optimize based on performance metrics
- **Dependency Risk**: Reliance on specific model providers
  - *Mitigation*: Maintain fallback options and monitor model availability

### Trade-offs
- **Complexity vs Performance**: Multiple models increase system complexity but provide better performance
- **Cost vs Quality**: Specialized models may cost more but deliver superior results
- **Speed vs Capability**: Gemma3 prioritizes speed while Qwen3 prioritizes reasoning capability
